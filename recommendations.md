- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/installation/) (Linux, Windows, macOS): Firefox fork with good privacy out of the box. The configuration leads to some sites malfunctioning

- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android): The Tor browser connects to the internet via the Tor network. It is used to connect to the "deep web" (.onion).
