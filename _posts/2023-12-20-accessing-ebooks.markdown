# Quick Downloading
If you're not planning on managing a large library of ebooks, your go-to site should be [Library Genesis][libgen]. It lets you filter by category, search by ISBN, author etc. If it is blocked, see the [appropriate FAQ section](/faq/#url-blocked).

# Managing and Curating your Ebook Library
If you're planning to download a lot of ebooks to your device, you might want an interface to manage them aswell as have a proper reader for EPUB files.

The program I use foor this purpose is the [Calibre][calibre] ebook reader and manager.
It is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. 
The functionality for mobile operating systems is severely limited. On Android and iOS, the Calibre app only connects to a computer running calibre (tldr: If you want mobile Calibre, you need a computer already running it).

# Downloading Books from Library Genesis directly to Calibre
Calibre has an extensive plugin repository maintained by the community.

A plugin I can recommend is the [Libgen Calibre Store][store-plugin] plugin. It lets you search for and download from Library Genesis directly from the Calibre interface. To install it, follow [these steps][store-plugin-install].

# Libgen doesn't have your book?
You can always try alternative sources. [Hatt](/hatt/) lets you search multiple sites at once.
