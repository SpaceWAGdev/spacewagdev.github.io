### A URL you linked to is blocked in my country / on my managed device / my managed network. What do I do?
You can use something like Startpage's _Anonymous View_. [NON-FOSS] It redirects all of your traffic thorugh Startpage's servers, so your network, your device aswell as the website's owner only see Startpage's proxy. Alternatively, you can use the VPN of your choice.

### Do you recommend non-FOSS software?
If I endorse a software that is not FOSS, it will be signified by the [NON-FOSS] mark.
